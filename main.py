# Tasks

# 1. Review all necessary materials for getting started

# 2. Create your project (including setting up your GitHub repository for source control)

# 3. Create all of the classes for the project based off of the UML

# 4. Starting with the smallest class, write the methods for your classes.

# 5. Work through the user stories as you write methods, testing each method before moving on!

# Setup Steps

# 1. Create a folder for your project, then create a GitHub repository for the project.

# 2. Clone down the repository to your computer and put the invisible .git folder inside your project folder (as well as the .gitignore and README). 
    # Make an initial commit.

# 3. Create a new file for each class on the UML, as well as a main.py file that will serve as the entry point of your application.

# 4. Begin working on the user stories by filling in your classes from smallest to large. Begin with the Weapon class, then move on to the Robot class, 
    # then the Dinosaur class.

# 5. Once those classes are tested, move on to the Herd and Fleet classes (these will look very similar once they are done!)

# 6. Finally, fill out the methods for your battle logic in the Battlefield class. You will only need to import the Fleet and Herd classes into the
    #  Battlefield class.

# 7. You will run the game by creating an object from the Battlefield class inside of main.py and calling the run_game method!

# End Result

# Please see the Project Walkthrough â€“ Robots vs. Dinosaurs video for an idea of how the final product will look!


from Battlefield import Battlefield


lets_fight = Battlefield() 
lets_fight.battle()
# lets_fight.run_battle() #probably going in battlefield class
